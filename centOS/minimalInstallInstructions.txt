In a minimal install you won't have things like if tools or git.
You will need to install them.

To install net-tools (which has the ifconfig utility):

sudo yum -y install net-tools

To install the git client:

sudo -y install git

After that clone the opal repository with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/ntavendale/opal

After this navigate to the centOS folder:

cd ./opal/centOS
